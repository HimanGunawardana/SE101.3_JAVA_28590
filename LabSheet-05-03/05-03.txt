The code you provided has a syntax error. It appears that you're trying to define a class hierarchy with a final class Student and an inner class Undergraduate that extends Student. However, there are a few issues with the code:

The inner class Undergraduate should be declared as static to be used within the Student class. Otherwise, it would require an instance of the outer class to be instantiated.

The display() method in the Student class is declared as final but lacks a method body. A final method cannot be overridden by subclasses, so it should have an implementation.
