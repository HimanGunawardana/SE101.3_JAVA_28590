701. Try to declare the variable with/without public static final keywords. Is there any difference between these two approaches? Why?

    No difference.
    When declaring the variable "x" in the interface, we don't need to use the keywords "public," "static," or "final.
    " The variable is automatically considered public, static, and final within the interface. 
    Using or omitting these keywords will have the same effect.

02. Declare the abstract method with/without abstract keyword. Is there any difference between these two approaches? Why?
    
    No difference.
    Similarly, when declaring an abstract method in an interface, we don't need to use the "abstract" keyword explicitly. 
    All methods declared in an interface are implicitly abstract. 
    Using or omitting the "abstract" keyword will not make any difference.

03. Implement this into a class called “IntefaceImplemented” . Override all the abstract methods. 
    Try to change the value of x inside this method and print the value of x. Is it possible for you to change x? why?

    In the "InterfaceImplemented" class, we implement the "MyFirstInterface" interface. 
    We override the abstract method "display()" as required. 
    However, attempting to modify the value of "x" inside this method will result in a compilation error. 
    The variable "x" is implicitly final within the interface, which means its value cannot be changed once assigned. 
    Therefore, you cannot modify the value of "x" in the implementing class.
